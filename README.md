# Personality Prediction
The Project aims to develop a Machine Learning Model using Tensorflow for Predicting Personality Trait based on 16-Personality system from Jungian Psychology. I have choosen this project for my machine learning course in college.

## Dataset
I used a 16Personality-Dataset from Kaggle as Dataset for Training and Testing.

## Model Architecture
### Model
I have used 4 differernt models, which are used together to complete the prediction
**IEModel**, **NSModel**, **FTModel**, **PJModel**

### Accuracy
The Resulted Accuracy fouond with all models
IEModel -> 80
NSModel -> 85
FTModel -> 80
PJModel -> 73

## Result
The Average Accuracy including all the models acoounted to 80%. This is not a High Accuracy and there still some room for improvement.
